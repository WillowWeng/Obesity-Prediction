# Obesity Prediction

## üí° Project Overview

The team analyzed 2,111 health condition records from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, covering 16 variables such as age, gender, BMI, dietary habits, physical activity, sleep duration, and calorie intake. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to address outliers and ensure data quality. To predict obesity, the team applied linear regression, logistic regression, and CART models, evaluating their performance based on generalization ability. The results showed that the CART model achieved the highest predictive performance, with an accuracy of 78%, precision of 77%, and recall of 78%, making it the most suitable model for this task. According to the CART model‚Äôs feature importance ranking, age, height, frequency of vegetable consumption, number of main meals, and time spent using technological devices were identified as the five most influential indicators of obesity, with importance scores of 15.4%, 14.5%, 12.5%, 10.4%, and 8.9%, respectively. These findings provide valuable insights for healthcare organizations seeking to design targeted interventions and preventive strategies to combat obesity.

## üåé Background

Obesity has become one of the most pressing global health challenges, with rising prevalence in both developed and developing countries. In Latin America, particularly in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, obesity rates have increased significantly in recent years due to rapid urbanization, sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy dietary patterns. This condition not only increases the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders but also places a heavy burden on national healthcare systems. Given the complexity of factors influencing obesity‚Äîincluding genetic, behavioral, and environmental elements‚Äîdata-driven analysis has become an essential tool for understanding its root causes and developing effective prevention strategies. Against this backdrop, this project was initiated to analyze regional health data and identify the primary contributors to obesity through advanced analytical and predictive modeling techniques.

## üéØ Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to help obese individuals and healthcare organizations better understand the key causes and risk factors of obesity through comprehensive data analysis. Using 2,111 health condition records collected from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, the study examined 16 variables, including age, gender, BMI, dietary habits, physical activity level, daily calorie intake, sleep duration, blood pressure, glucose level, and family medical history. By integrating behavioral, physiological, and demographic data, the project aims to uncover how lifestyle patterns and biological indicators interact to influence obesity. The ultimate objective is to provide evidence-based insights that support healthcare organizations in developing targeted intervention strategies, personalized health recommendations, and public awareness initiatives to prevent and manage obesity more effectively.
